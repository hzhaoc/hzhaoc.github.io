brief: 'a disjoint set'

Union-find, or disjoint-set, is a data structure that supports fast categorization/grouping (the 'union') and group id lookup for a member (the 'find'). 

### Normal Unions
-   Property
    -   Each vertex/element belongs to a group/cluster/leader
    -   Each vertex/element points to a leader vertex in that group.
    -   this leader is their parent vertex
-   Merge/Union optimize
    -   in each merge, update the smaller sized group's leader
-   Pros & Cons
    -   **Find() takes O(1)** (Find() finds the leader vertex)
    -   **Union() worst case takes O(n)**
    -   In MST, total Union() operations is O(nlogn)

###  Lazy Unions
-   Property similar to Normal Unions except that:
    -   Update only one pointer in each union by making one group's leader a child of the other one
    -   Leader is the root vertex
-   Merge/Union optimize
    -   Union by rank.
	```C++
	S1 = Find(x)
	S2 = Find(y)
	if rank(S1) > rank(S2){
		parent[S2] = S1
	} elif rank(S1) < rank(S2){
		parent[S1] = S2
	} else {
		parent[S2] = S1
		ranks[S1] += 1
	}
	```
-   Update ranks to restore invariant
-   Path compression to optimize find
    -   After Find(x), rewire parent pointers directly to root along the path X-X_Root
    -   Hopcroft-Ullman Theorem
        -   With Union by Rank and Path Compression. In n vertex graph, M union operations take **O(mlog\*n)** time, where log\*n = the number of times you need to apply log to n before the result is \<= 1. E.g. log\* 2\^65536 = 5
        -   I haven't walk through the proof myself yet.
        -   Not optimal yet
    -   Ackerman Function
        -   Tarjar's Bound (theoretical): with union by rank and path compression, In n vertex graph, M union operations take **O(mα(n)),** where α(n) is the inverse Ackerman Function that's even much smaller than **log\*n**

-   Pros & Cons after Optimize
    -   Union() reduces to two Find()
    -   **Find() and Union() worse case takes O(logn)** (Find() finds the leader vertex)

## implementation
- lazy union
```python
class UnionFind:
	"""
	Lazy Union: In union(x, y) function, link x's root's parent to y's root
	total work of m finds (m is # of edges) = O(m* alpha(n))
	"""

		self._n_of_union = len(vertexes)

	@classmethod
	def _initfromGraph(cls, graph):
		"""init union find object from class of graph"""
		return cls(graph.vertexes)

	def find(self, x):
		# optimize by Path Compression

			return x
		return self.find(self._parents[x])

	def union(self, x, y):
		# optimize by Union by Rank
		x_root = self.find(x)
		y_root = self.find(y)
		if x_root == y_root: # already in same group
			return
		self._n_of_union -= 1  # union makes number of unions decrease by 1
		x_rank = self._ranks[x_root]
		y_rank = self._ranks[y_root]
		if x_rank > y_rank:  # make y root point to x root
			self._parents[y_root] = x_root
		elif x_rank < y_rank:  # do opposite
			self._parents[x_root] = y_root
		else:  # x_rank == y_rank, arbitrarily do same as x_rank > y_rank, additionally add 1 to x's root's rank
			self._parents[y_root] = x_root
			self._ranks[x_root] += 1
