Find shortest path and distance in a directed/undirected graph {vertex, edge}

## Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Compute shortest distance between a starting vertex and all other vertexes in a graph. You can also track shortest path simultaneously.

The idea is:
- start from target vertex, explore neighbor vertexes by order of cumulative distance (ascending)
- if vertex to be explored is already explored, ignore;
- if vertex to be explored is new, update cumulative distance.

How does this make sure distance to each vertex is minimum? The key is to explore vertices in order of distance. (this is implemented by heap) 

Time Complexity: $O(mlogn)$, m = # of edges, n = # of vertexes

Pros:
1. can deal with directed graph, undirected graph, non-negatives paths

Cons:
1. can't be applied to negative edge lengths (can be improved?. See below code implementation)
2. not very distributed (relevant to Internet routing)

#### Code Implementation
```python
class Graph:
	def __init__(self, adjacencyList=None):
		if not adjacencyList:
			self.G = defaultdict(list)
			self.G_rev = defaultdict(list)
		else:
			self.G = adjacencyList

	def addEdge(self, u, v):
		self.G[u].append(v)
		self.G_rev[v].append(u)
		return

	def addEdgeLen(self, u, v, l):
		self.G[u].append((v, l)) 
		return

	def minDist(self, start):
		maxdist = float('inf')
		dists = {v: maxdist for v in self.G.keys()}
		seen = set()
		pq = [(0, start)]
		while pq:
			cur_dist, cur_v = heapq.heappop(pq)
			if cur_v in seen:
				continue
			dists[cur_v] = cur_dist
			seen.add(cur_v)
			for neighbor, weight in self.G[cur_v]:
				if neighbor in seen:
					continue
				dist = cur_dist + weight
				heapq.heappush(pq, (dist, neighbor))
		return dists
```

## Bellman Ford Algorithm
Either compute a shortest cycle-free path $s-v$ or output a negative cycle, for all paths starting from $s$. This is a Dynamic Programming solution.

#### Identify optimal sub-structures & base cases
Since subpath of a shortest path is by itself a shortest path, for a shortest path s-v, it can be broken into shortest of all shortest paths w-v (w is any adjacent vertex of v's) plus its last edge cost C(w,v). Is this enough? When the structure is broken into sub-structures, we notice number of edges in the subpath decrease by 1. And this information needs to be reflected in the program. Therefore, we assign a budget (number of edges needed at maximum) for any structure of shortest path s-v. Easily known, this budget is no bigger than vertex # -  1. And we have our base case $A[x, s] = 0$, which means shortest distance s-s with any number of edges is 0. Remaining elements in $A$ will be initialized to $+\infty$. Also notice with budget introduced, there's also a case when $A[v,  i] = A[v,i-1]$ when $i$ number of edges is enough for optimal path $s-v$ 

#### Pseudo code & analysis
- Let $L_{i,v}$ = minimum length of a $s-v$ path with edge number $n\leq{i}$. $l_{i, j}$ = edge length of $e(i, j)$. Cycles allowed. And $+ \infty$ if no such path exists
	- For $i = 1, 2, ..., n-1$: ($n$ if one (**only one!**) negative cycle existence needs to be checked) 
		- For $v = 1, 2, ..., n$:
			- $L_{i,v}=\min\left\{ \begin{matrix} L_{\left( i - 1 \right),\ v} \\ \min_{(w,v) \in E}\left\{ L_{\left( i - 1 \right),w} + l_{w,v} \right\} \\  \end{matrix} \right.\ $
			- meanwhile, keep track of Predecessor pointers $B[i, v]$ = 2nd-last vertex in the shortest path. this will track shortest paths. note that $B[0, v] = null$.
			- with no negative cycles:  if $L_{i, v}=L_{i-1, v}$ ($v$ is target vertex). This means optimal path is already found for path $s-v$. Can exit early. 
			- *if only need to check negative cycle: check last iteration (n) and see if there's improvement in distance; if also need to find the negative cycle path: use DFS to check for a cycle of predecessor pointers at every iteration*.

> Why only one more iteration is sufficient to capture **one** negative cycle in shortest path? 
> - If there's **1** negative-cycle in shortest s-v, one of the vertex in the path Must be visited Twice, number of edges for the budget will increase by one. n-1 => n.
> - Extension: I think **K** additional iterations on top of original 0 -> n-1 will be able to capture K negative cycles in the shortest path s-v, since one negative cycle makes one vertex visited one more time, increasing edge number budget by 1.

- Time Complexity is $O(mn)$ without negative edges.

> Why it is not the intuitive answer $O(n^2)$?
> total work is $O(n*\sum_{v\in{V}}{\text{in-degree}(v)})$ = $O(n*m)$

- Space Complexity: $O(n^2)$
	- Space optimization: 
		- only need $A[i-1, v]$ to compute $A[i, v]$ for any $v$ in vertexes. $O(n)$
		- if only check negative cycle, $B$ also needs only $O(n)$. if need to store the path, still need $O(n^2)$ for $B[i, v]$.
- Modifications toward a routing protocol: 
	- Examples: RIP, RIP2.
	- Switch from source-driven to destination-driven.
		- reverse algorithm and edge direction.
		- each $v$ maintains shortest path distance to destination $t$, plus the first edge/hop.
	- Handling asynchrony: switch from 'pull-based' to 'push-based' 
		- as soon as $A[i,v] < A[i-1, v]$, $v$ notifies (push) all of its neighbors for updates
		- algorithm guaranteed to converge eventually, **assuming no negative cycles**. Reason: updates decrease shortest distance
	- Handling failures -- when an edge is broken
		- change: each $v$ maintains shortest path distance to destination $t$, plus the ENTIRE PATH. Cons: more space required.

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
Compute all pairs of shortest paths (APSP) and report relevant negative cycles if any. This is a [[Dynamic Programming]] solution.

#### Identify optimal sub-structures
we know a subpath of a shortest path is in itself a shortest path. This time we don't break down an optimal path into a sub-optimal path and last edge, but two shortest paths (with a shared intermediary internal vertex of course). Notice also during this breakdown, for internal vertices of a path, the shared vertex is out. If we pre-index the vertexes 1, 2, ..., n, then during the optimal sub-structure breakdown, we can search for $f(K)$ which denotes vertexes 1 to K used for an optimal structure. If vertex $K$ is an internal vertex for the optimal path A[s, v, K] (denoting optimal distance between s and v,  with 1,2,...,K vertex as internal vertices), then its two optimal sub-paths will be exactly $A[s,k,k-1]$ and  $A[k,v,k-1]$. 

Base cases & initialization: 
- $A[s,s,0]=0$
- if $(s-v)\in{E}$: $A[s,v,0]=C(s,v)$
- for remaining $(s,v)$: $A[s,v,0]=\infty$

Also notice with budget introduced, there's also a case when $A[s,v,k]=A[s,v,k-1]$ when $1,2,...k-1$ internal vertexes are enough for optimal path $s-v$ 

#### pseudo code & analysis
```C
preindex vertices as 1,2,...,n
let A[s,v,K] denote shortest distance s-v, with internal vertices 1,2,...K. 
let B[s,v] denote max index in its internal vertices.

for k=1 to n:
	for i=1 to n:
		for j=1 to n:
			A[i,j,k] = min{A[i,j,k-1], A[i,k,k-1] + A[k,j,k-1]}
			B[i,j] = k if A[i,j,k] gets updated // it means k is an internal vertex to path i-j
```

- what about negative cycles?
	- when the algorithm is run, check $A[i,i,k]$ for any $i, k$.  If one of them is **negative**, negative cycle exists.
-   Time complexity: 
	-   $O(n^3)$ (n: vertex #;  m: edge #;)
- important special case: transitive closure of a binary relation (basically means you only need to check if two vertexes s-v has a path.). specifically,  change one line to 
```C
	A[i,j,k] = max{A[i,j,k-1], A[i,k,k-1] * A[k,j,k-1]}
```

## Johnson's Algorithm
Compute all pairs of shortest paths (APSP). This is a [[Dynamic Programming]] solution.

#### Motivation
running time wise, n\*Dijkstra is better than n\*Bellman Ford, but Dijkstra can not deal with negative edges. And only in dense graph ($n=O(m^2)$), Floyd-Warshall is better than n\*Dijkstra. So how to apply fast Dijkstra with negative edges in graph?
-   Time complexity: (n: vertex #;  m: edge #;)
	- $O(n^2m)$ for n\*Bellman Ford
	- $O(nmlogn)$ for n\*Dijkstra
	- $O(n^3)$ for Floyd-Warshall
	
#### Core idea
Reweight edge costs **in a way** that makes:
- there's no negative edges, so we can use Dijkstra which is fast in sparse graph
- new shortest path is the same path as before, so reweighting does no change the answers

but how?
-  consider assign an weight to each vertex, denoted as $w_v$, and modify edge costs to $c'(u,v)=c(u,v)+w_u-w_v$. to calculate a new shortest path distance: $D'(u,v)=D(u,v)+w_u-w_v$ for any $(u,v)$ pair in the modified graph. (all internal terms are canceled through tail-to-head). this means shortest path for $(u,v)$ does not change. Also all edges related to $s$ are outbound so it won't affect shortest-path algorithm.

yet how to assign such weights?
-  notice that if we arbitrarily add an additional vertex $s$, with only outgoing edges to each of original vertices with $0$ distance, run a Bellman Ford on $s$, assign weight $w_v$ to each original vertex $v$ so that $w=D(s,v)$ for any $s,v$pair, where $D(s,v)$ is shortest path distance between $s,v$. Then in the modified graph, new shortest distance $D'(u,v)=D(u,v)+w_u-w_v > 0$. 

why new edges are guaranteed to be non-negative?
- consider any edge $e(u,v)$. After adding new vertex $s$ and reweighting:
	- if $u$ is the 2nd-last vertex in the shortest path $(s,v)$: $$C'(u,v)=C(u,v)+D(s,u)-D(s,v)=C(u,v)+D(s,u)-(D(s,u)+C(u,v))=0$$
	- if $u$ is NOT the 2nd-last vertex in the shortest path $(s,v)$, say it is $t$.  
		- we know $$D(s,u)+C(u,v)\geq D(s,t)+C(t,v)$$
		- for new edge cost, we have $$C'(u,v)=C(u,v)+D(s,u)-D(s,v)$$
		- then $$C'(u,v)\geq [D(s,t)+C(t,v)-D(s,u)]+D(s,u)-D(s,v)=D(s,t)+C(t,v)-D(s,v)=D(s,v)-D(s,v)=0$$
		- thus we proved, for any edge in graph $G$, new edge cost will be non-negative.


#### Pseudo code & analysis
1. add new vertex $s$, outgoing arc to each original vertex with distance **0**. 
2. run 1 Bellman Ford on $s$. 
3. assign weights to each vertex $v$ = shortest distance $D(s,v)$. edit new edge cost = old edge cost + tail weight - head weight
4. run N Dijkstra for the graph on new edge costs. then you get all pairs of shortest paths. reverse edit shortest path distance by actual distance = new distance + head weight - tail weight

- dominate run time is at step 4. $O(nmlogn)$
- compare it to other algorithms, it is fast at $O(nmlogn)$, and deal with negative edges.
