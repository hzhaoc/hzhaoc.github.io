Union-find, or disjoint-set, is a data structure that supports fast categorization/grouping (the 'union') and group id lookup for a member (the 'find'). 

### Normal Unions
-   Property
    -   Each vertex/element belongs to a group/cluster/leader
    -   Each vertex/element points to a leader vertex in that group.
    -   this leader is their parent vertex
-   Merge/Union optimize
    -   in each merge, update the smaller sized group's leader
-   Pros & Cons
    -   **Find() takes O(1)** (Find() finds the leader vertex)
    -   **Union() worst case takes O(n)**
    -   In MST, total Union() operations is O(nlogn)

###  Lazy Unions
-   Property similar to Normal Unions except that:
    -   Update only one pointer in each union by making one group's leader a child of the other one
    -   Leader is the root vertex
-   Merge/Union optimize
    -   Union by rank.
	```C++
	S1 = Find(x)
	S2 = Find(y)
	if rank(S1) > rank(S2){
		parent[S2] = S1
	} elif rank(S1) < rank(S2){
		parent[S1] = S2
	} else {
		parent[S2] = S1
		ranks[S1] += 1
	}
	```
-   Update ranks to restore invariant
-   Path compression to optimize find
    -   After Find(x), rewire parent pointers directly to root along the path X-X_Root
    -   Hopcroft-Ullman Theorem
        -   With Union by Rank and Path Compression. In n vertex graph, M union operations take **O(mlog\*n)** time, where log\*n = the number of times you need to apply log to n before the result is \<= 1. E.g. log\* 2\^65536 = 5
        -   I haven't walk through the proof myself yet.
        -   Not optimal yet
    -   Ackerman Function
        -   Tarjar's Bound (theoretical): with union by rank and path compression, In n vertex graph, M union operations take **O(mα(n)),** where α(n) is the inverse Ackerman Function that's even much smaller than **log\*n**

-   Pros & Cons after Optimize
    -   Union() reduces to two Find()
    -   **Find() and Union() worse case takes O(logn)** (Find() finds the leader vertex)
