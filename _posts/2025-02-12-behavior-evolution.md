# Evolution Behavior
### 3 building blocks
1. individual selection: goal is to maximize copies of one's own genes in next production
2. kin selection: help kins for reproduction because they share gens
3. reciprocal altruism
  - game theory. cooperation and cheating
  - tit for tat -> forgiving tit for tat -> trust-based tit for tat

- imprinted genges: only in tournament-based specicies. male part of gene and female part of gene may do opposite respective purpose for competition
- founder effect
