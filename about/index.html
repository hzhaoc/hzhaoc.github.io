    <!-- <h2>About</h2> -->
    <p> 
        I'm a software engineer with overflowed interests in mechatronics, space and beyond.
        Recently (2023-12) I started picking up chess and competitive programming as games.
        Besides keeping "boring" textbooks for studies, I occasionally watch podcast (Lex fan here), read people's bios, views and values from books, anything that can inspire me to keep searching for a meaning in the world.

        I have a Panasonic miniDV from 2000s.

        Growing up I used to play lots of sports. 
        Early this 2023 I stopped private pilot training in favor of other plans but intend to go back and get the license. People in the aviation club are cool-minded towards life.

        I had tried to have raised 6 dogs or so and 1 cat back in China.
        Most of them are some hybrids of Chinese brand (Tugou) and they are the ones people ignore the most.

        As of 2020s California is still the symbol of spirit of entrepreneurship, and to some degree the place to overpower traditions and find common truth.

        In here, there's a mountain I have to climb.
