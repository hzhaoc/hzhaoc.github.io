    <!-- <h2>About</h2> -->
    <p>I'm a software engineer with extra interests in mechatronics and beyond, picking up chess and competitive programming as hobbies recently (2023-12).
       Besides "boring" textbooks, I occasionally watch podcast (Lex fan here), read other people's bios, teachings or philosophies whispered in books.
       I stopped my privat pilot training early this 2023 because I just didn't have enough energy on weekends to do it at the time. 
       I intend to go back - I made a good friend there and the sky is beautiful.
