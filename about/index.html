    <!-- <h2>About</h2> -->
    <p>I'm a software engineer with extra interests in mechatronics and beyond, picking up chess and competitive programming as hobbies recently (2023-12).
       Besides "boring" textbooks, I occasionally watch podcast (Lex fan here), read other people's bios, teachings or philosophies whispered in books.
       I stopped my privat pilot training in early 2023 because of time constraint but intend to go back - the sky is beautiful.
