    <!-- <h2>About</h2> -->
    <p>I'm a software engineer with extra interests in mechatronics and beyond, picking up chess and competitive programming as hobbies recently (2023-12).
       Besides "boring" textbooks, I occasionally read bios, watch podcast (Lex fan here), and other forms of personal work - people's wisdom in general passed down in history.
